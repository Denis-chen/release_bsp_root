    <short>Startup for Freescale i.MX35 3DS boards</short>
    <abstract><![CDATA[
	                The startup-3dsmx35 program is responsible for the second stage initialization of the Freescale i.MX35 3DS boards. This stage mainly involves populating the syspage, which is an in-memory data structure that contains information about the system, such as memory size and location, information about the CPU(s), caches, clocks and timers, and interrupt subsystem. At runtime, the information in the syspage is accessed and used by procnto, and by various processes.
